Insurance Regression Prediction
This project focuses on predicting insurance costs using regression techniques. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates insurance premiums based on customer data.

Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and outliers.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Modeling: Regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ².
Dataset
The dataset includes features like age, gender, BMI, region, smoking status, and charges (target variable).
Tools & Libraries
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
